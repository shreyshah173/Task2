Build application with frontend and backend where you register a user and assign roles and permission to the user and based on roles display different view
 
Roles and Permission should be a Middleware in backend
 
Backend should be service driven architecture and preferably a microservice approach.
 
2 roles and permission based role.
 
i. Role A uploads a document
 
ii. Role B approves the uploaded document after viewing
